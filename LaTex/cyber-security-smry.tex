\begin{abstract}
In an era where digital infrastructure underpins critical societal functions, effective cybersecurity measures have become essential. As the sophistication of cyber threats escalates, it is crucial for security mechanisms to evolve. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are advancing cybersecurity by enabling faster, more adaptive, and predictive threat detection and response \cite{sarker2024}. We outline the core domains of cybersecurity, comparing traditional approaches with AI-powered solutions and including practical, benefit-focused use cases and success metrics.

\section{Network Security}
Network security aims to safeguard the transmission of data across organizational networks. It employs tools such as firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and network architectures to block unauthorized access and ensure data integrity \cite{sarker2024}.

\subsection{Traditional Approach}
Companies have historically relied on rule-based firewalls and signature-based IDS, which required regular updates and human intervention.

\subsubsection{Traditional Use Case}
An organization uses a signature-based IDS to monitor network traffic for known malware. Although effective at identifying familiar threats, it struggles to detect new attack patterns, resulting in potential delays in responding to emerging threats.

\subsubsection{Traditional Benefits}
Provides a basic layer of protection but requires constant updates and manual analysis, which can lead to inefficiencies and blind spots.

\subsection{AI Enhancement}
AI transforms network security through:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item Real-time monitoring and pattern recognition
    \item Automated threat detection and response
    \item Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AI Use Case}
An AI-powered system continuously monitors network traffic, detecting unusual patterns like data transfers at odd hours. The system can automatically block suspicious activity, reducing response times and preventing breaches.

\subsubsection{AI Benefits}
Enhances threat detection capabilities, minimizes manual intervention, and proactively protects the network.

\subsection{Key AI Techniques}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item \textbf{Analyzing Patterns}: AI examines data flow for unusual activities that could signal a security threat
    \item \textbf{Learning Behavior}: AI learns what normal network activity looks like and alerts the team if something unusual happens
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item Time to Detect and Respond to Threats
    \item False Positive Rate
    \item Pattern Recognition Accuracy
\end{itemize}

\section{Endpoint Security}
\subsection{Overview}
Endpoint security focuses on protecting devices like laptops, smartphones, and servers that connect to a network \cite{unknown}. Solutions include antivirus software, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and device management protocols.

\subsection{Traditional Approach}
Organizations have relied on antivirus software that scans for known malware signatures, requiring frequent updates.

\subsubsection{Traditional Use Case}
A company deploys antivirus software on employee devices. While effective at detecting known malware, it leaves endpoints vulnerable to new and advanced threats.

Provides foundational protection but needs constant maintenance and is limited in handling new threats.

\subsection{AI Enhancement}
AI provides continuous monitoring and real-time threat detection through:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item Behavioral analysis of devices
    \item Automated threat containment
    \item Predictive threat detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AI Use Case}
An AI-driven EDR system monitors device activities, such as unauthorized data encryption attempts, and isolates the device to prevent further damage.

\subsubsection{AI Benefits}
Proactively blocks threats, reduces response times, and minimizes damage.

\subsection{Key AI Techniques}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Devices}: AI watches how devices behave and stops anything suspicious immediately
    \item \textbf{Recognizing Threats}: AI detects signs of danger, like ransomware encrypting files, and takes quick action
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Success Metrics}
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
    \item Malware Detection Rate
    \item Time to Containment of Endpoint Threats
\end{itemize}

\section{Application Security}
\subsection{Overview}
Application security involves securing software applications throughout their lifecycle, from development through deployment \cite{bautista2018}. It includes following secure coding practices, conducting regular software updates, and deploying application firewalls.

\subsection{Traditional Approach}
Manual code reviews and periodic penetration testing were common methods used to identify security vulnerabilities.

\subsubsection{Traditional Use Case}
A development team conducts manual code reviews to check for common security issues. This process is time-consuming and often misses subtle vulnerabilities.
